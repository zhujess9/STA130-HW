    "*Research Question 1:* \n",
    "Does the frequency of how often you keep in touch with your immediate family impact your mental health when living away from home?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "- How often the individual visits home; measured ordinal (never, weekly, monthly, once a year, a few times a year)\n",
    "Why this variable: If the individual is regularly seeing their immediate family, there may not be a huge emotional strain of living away from home.\n",
    "- How far the individual is away from their family; measured ordinal (less than 50 km, 50-100 km, 100-500 km, 500+ km)\n",
    "Why this variable: Somewhat related to the first variable because the closer the individual is to their home, the more often they're able to visit. Another reason why is because simply having the reassurance of \"I can go home whenever I need. My family are closeby\" can relieve the strain of living away.\n",
    "- How close the individual's bonds are with their family; measured by scale(?), (1: not close at all - 5: extremely close)\n",
    "Why this variable: Some individuals who do not have a good relationship with their family may find it refreshing to have moved out. Their lack of contact with their family does not impact them as much as someone who is very close with their family.\n",
    "- How social the individual is with people outside their family; \"I socially interact with non-family members: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rarely\"\n",
    "Why this variable: Spending quality time with friends or other people outside of your family can also relieve the emotional strain becausse the individual is still having social interactions. Compared to an individual who is socially isolated, they may begin depend on their family for social fulfillment.\n",
    "- The individual's mental health history; could measure by nominal scale [ex: \"has history of mental health issues\" vs \"no history of mental health issues\"] or measured binary \"Yes/No\"\n",
    "Why this variable: We should consider the individual's mental health history since we are analyzing whether the question's objective will impact their mental health.\n",
    "- The individuals living situation; measured by nominal scale (living alone, w/roommates, living with non-immediate family, etc)\n",
    "Why this variable: Those who live with roommates or non-immediate family can still have their social fulfillment met since they are living closely around people. Those who are living alone may feel more isolated in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Analysis Performance*\n",
    "\n",
    "I could analyze data by using linear regression. My objective is to quantify whether frequence family contact will impact mental health. Using linear regression can assess the relationship between contact frequency and mental health scores, whilst controlling the variables listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*My Hypothesis*\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals who maintain frequent and quality contact with immediate family will have better mental health outcomes compared to those with less.\n",
    "\n",
    "If my analysis shows a significant positive correlation between frequent family contact and mental health scores (lowered levels of anxiety, stress, feelings of homesickness), it can suggest that regular communication helps improve mental well being. This would support my initial thought that strong familial ties can be critical for individuals living away from home, especially for the first time."

    "*Research Question 2:*\n",
    "Does gossiping (divisive) with others strengthens bonds and improve moods by creating shared connections?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bond Strength; measured by scale(?) (On a scale of 1-5, how close did you feel with this person before the conversation vs after the conversation?) Why this variable: I can quantify the level of bonding after gossiping and assess whether the bond has been strengthened.\n",
    "- Mood Change; measured by the individual rating how they feel after (How did you feel before gossiping vs after gossiping: \"Very Negative\" - \"Very Positive\". Why this variable: By measuring the mood change, I can see whether there has been an improvement in mood/if there has been a release of positive brain chemicals.\n",
    "- Gossiping Frequency; measured ordinal (daily, weekly, monthly). Why this variable: I'd want to see if those who gossip frequently would experience more frequent/increased levels of bonding experience or mood effects from those who don't gossip as much.\n",
    "- How comfortable someone is gossiping (potentially negatively about someone); measured by scale? (\"Do you feel comfortable talking about other people?\" \"Yes, Somewhat, No, Depends\"). Why this variable: I want to compare whether those who are hesitant of gossiping will feel more satisfied, if not the same, than those who are comfortable about gossiping.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Analysis Performance*\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1: Descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal would be to summarize data which will provide a distribution view of the main variables. I can calculate means, medians, stds for continuous variables such as bond strength and mood ratings. I can do a report count/percentage for categorical variables such as gossip frequency (may need to brainstorm more variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2: Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to see how well the variables explain how close individuals feel towards each other and whether there has been an improvement in mood. If we consider bond strength and mood improvement are measured as continuous outcomes, the linear regression can show how well the variables can vary the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*My Hypothesis*\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who partake in divisive gossiping may feel closer with those they talk with because it creates a sense of community/pact since they found a common adversary. In turn, having someone who you feel agrees with you about someone else's character may strengthen your friendship and decrease loneliness, perhaps releasing dopamine and lifting moods. I want to also see if individuals feel like they relieved stress after gossiping, and if there was an improvement in mental wellbeing. However, reckless gossiping may lead someone into unwanted drama which can outcast them from social groups and have them end up ultimately isolated."
